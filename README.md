The objective of this project is to analyze mental health–related data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Google Colab and transform these findings into actionable visual insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Understand patterns and trends related to mental disorders such as anxiety, stress, depression, or mood disorders.

Clean, preprocess, and explore the dataset using Python-based EDA techniques.

Identify key factors influencing mental health outcomes and highlight correlations between demographic, psychological, and behavioral variables.

Detect anomalies, outliers, and missing data to improve data quality for reliable analysis.

Convert analytical insights into dynamic Power BI visuals, enabling stakeholders to interact with the data and uncover meaningful insights.

Support data-driven decision-making for mental-health researchers, clinicians, HR departments, or policy stakeholders by providing clear, accessible reports.

Ultimately, this project bridges Python EDA and Power BI visualization to create a comprehensive, insight-driven mental health analysis workflow.
